            My teaching reflects and complements my research, broader language interests and language activities.
            <br>
            <br>
            I teach syntax at all levels, from a large undergraduate course to graduate seminars. In all of these settings, there is a focus on the interactions between lesser-studied languages and syntactic theory. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I co-teach an interdisciplinary graduate-level course on Indigenous Language Revitalization with colleagues from the Linguistics and English departments and from the Graduate School of Education. This is the core course for the <a href="https://lx.berkeley.edu/academics/designated-emphasis-indigenous-language-revitalization" target="_blank">Designated Emphasis in Indigenous Language Revitalization</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Based on my work with individual language communities, I teach an upper-division linguistics course on the structure, history and sociolinguistics of a particular language. I have taught this course on Danish, Kalaallisut and Karuk.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, I teach "The American Languages" course, a lower-division course that introduces students of all backgrounds and stages of study to the richness and complexity of language in the US. The course satisfied the <a href="https://americancultures.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">American Cultures Requirement</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most of these classes include participation by members of the language communities I work with and student engagement with primary linguistic material.
