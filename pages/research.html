            My work includes traditional syntactic and semantic research as well as applied linguistics. Both strands are highly <a href="#" onclick="loadContent('collaborations')">collaborative</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            My early syntactic research was on Germanic syntax with empirical focus on clause structure (verb-second), anaphora, noun-incorporation, definiteness, DP-internal syntax, copular clauses, resumption, and the syntax-pragmatics interface. Since 2010 my research has expanded to include the syntax of Karuk (Hokan, California) and Kalaallisut (Inuit, Greenland). In Karuk I have pursued my interest in resumption further and Kalaallisut has renewed my interest in copular clauses and also allowed me to work on cross-clauses interactions, such as hyperraising and prolepsis.

            <br>
            My applied work has grown out of my engagement with <a href="#" onClick="loadContent('collaborations', 'project3')">Karuk</a> language and communities and centers on language documentation and revitalization. Specific revitalization activities include participation in language learning activities, curriculum development, development of an <a href="https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~karuk/index.php" target="_blank">online dictionary and text corpus</a>, and logistical and financial support for community activities. More recently, it has expanded to working with <a href="#" onClick="loadContent('collaborations', 'project4')">Chochenyo language and culture revitalization</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The work with Karuk communities also includes youth-oriented activities more broadly, annual UC Berkeley campus visits, opportunities for networking with UC Berkeley native students, and in-class presentations that contextualize the linguistic material.
